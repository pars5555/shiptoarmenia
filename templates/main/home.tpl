				<p><strong>SAFE</strong></p>
				<p>Holding safety as a value can mean an in-house culture of safety to protect the well-being of employees or customers who use a company’s products and services. A clinic might hold the safety and health of its workers as a central value using standardized protocols and training to avoid accidents. Companies offering children’s products should hold safety as a value to ensure child-safe products.</p>

				<p><strong>RELIABLE</strong></p>
				<p>Reliability implies many things. Reliable products must possess quality. They engender trust in their performance and their performance is predictable. Consumers feel secure and relaxed when given reliable goods and services. Reliability might also have a time dimension -- a regular order arriving “just like clockwork,” for instance. Zeroing in on why and how reliability benefits customers can make this value easier to demonstrate.</p>
